# Sailwing Position Sensor

It's a more robust alternative to a magnetic encoder which is sensitive to misalignment.

There are 16 Hall effect sensors around the mast which track a magnet mounted on the bottom of the sailwing. The accuracy is 360 / 32 = 11 degrees without calibration or 1-5 degrees after calibration (depending on the maximum allowed misalignment of the magnet).
